# Arisara-Yusamart_BEMM466_Business-Project
This repository contains the code for the BEMM466 Business Project. It is a Jupyter notebook that details our complete computational workflow, from data handling to model implementation and evaluation.
The final project report, which provides a comprehensive academic analysis and discussion of our findings, has been submitted separately.
The datasets used in this project are too large to be hosted on GitHub. All necessary data files are stored on a shared OneDrive folder.
